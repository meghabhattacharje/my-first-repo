Starting over again with GitHub

1st update : removed quotes from the first line & created a test file to check the usage of double quotes// in cmd no need to write echo "xyz abc" >test.txt , in Linux/git bash we need to write it.

brach-testing update: this will appear on 20aug.txt file in branch-testing branch and not in 20aug.txt file of main branch
